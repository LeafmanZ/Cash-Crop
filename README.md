# Cash-Crop
POC is the first tests that I made to accustom myself to the data I will be working with alongside with some barebones methodology that shows promise.

10V1 is the first serious approach I took to discover suitable models that can give intuition on what will work for the full 300 plant model.

I recommend looking at the Full Model as it is the one that works around the full 300 plant model.

Notebooks using Auto_V1 are currently recommmended for running currently. The only thing you need to to do is specify the base directory for your program and the notebook will run completely. No need to manually input multiple directories. Also you need to unzip the csv file for the Full Model.

 Probably best to download the notebooks as it appears github has difficulty loading this.
 
 Full Model only documents models tested and its subsequent results.
 
 Project no longer updated on github as workspace has moved to GCP and future results will no longer be public.

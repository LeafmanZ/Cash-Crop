POC is the first tests that I made to accustom myself to the data I will be working with alongside with some barebones methodology that shows promise.


10V1 is the first serious approach I am taking to discover suitable models that can give intuition on what will work for the full 300 plant model.

I recommend looking at 10V1 as it is the set that I have taken care to organize properly.

Notebooks using Auto_V1 are currently recommmended for running currently. The only thing you need to to do is specify the base directory for your program and the notebook will run completely. No need to manually input multiple directories.
